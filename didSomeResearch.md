### Day 6
I'll push this file so I will not kill my Github commit streak!

I did research today about if I want to stay on the Google ecosystem. I do use a lot of Google services at the moment. Such as:
- Gmail
- Google Calendar
- Google Assistant (Home)
- Chrome
- Password manager (will use a software for that in the future)
- Google Maps
- and probably more...

So I decided to do some research about privacy and how I can avoid as much tracking as possible. Main top-browsers available:

- Brave = Did a small research and check on this thread. Really insightful
	-  https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/ofnnlb/brave_browser_is_it_as_unsecure_as_the_firefox/
- Edge (Microsoft)
- Firefox (Mozzila = funded by Google)
- Safari (Apple is big on Privacy)

So for the time I will be on Windows I will use the Brave browser.

I will slowly but surely move my eco-system from Google to Apples.
Really looking forward to this upgrade in the near future.

## Day 10

Alright so, on days that I did not commit a thing but did research or spent time on learning to code I'll post just a commit in this file. I will probably make a new repo called code-research. In this text file I will then summarize what I've been studying. This way I will not break the chain and feel 'guilty'! The past few days I've configured a lot.

I now got the Brave browser working, also I will use Firefox for local development (due to that it works nicely with CSS). Also I did set-up a Password Manager (Bitwarden) and 2FA (Authy) for all my accounts. Further I did install a MacOS theme for my Windows 11 OS and also I configured the iOS 15 theme on my Android phone. Just for fun and aesthetic purposes.

Tomorrow I will put in some work in this repo and finish up the TDD tests.

## Day 11
Did put in an hour into a quick refresh with the videos in the Microsoft docs, Beginners to JavaScript series:
- JSON & Objects (Lessons 41, 42, 43 and 44)
- Promises + Async/Await (Lessons 45, 46, 47 and 48)
- npm (Lesson 50)
- Tomorrow I'll continue the TDD tests
