I'll push this file so I will not kill my Github commit streak!

I did research today about if I want to stay on the Google ecosystem. I do use a lot of Google services at the moment. Such as:
- Gmail
- Google Calendar
- Google Assistant (Home)
- Chrome
- Password manager (will use a software for that in the future)
- Google Maps
- and probably more...

So I decided to do some research about privacy and how I can avoid as much tracking as possible. Main top-browsers available:

- Brave = Did a small research and check on this thread. Really insightful
	-  https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/ofnnlb/brave_browser_is_it_as_unsecure_as_the_firefox/
- Edge (Microsoft)
- Firefox (Mozzila = funded by Google)
- Safari (Apple is big on Privacy)

So for the time I will be on Windows I will use the Brave browser.

I will slowly but surely move my eco-system from Google to Apples.
Really looking forward to this upgrade in the near future.
